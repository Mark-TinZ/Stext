**Stext** â€” a program that should recognize text from the screen or images on the screen. To implement the project, I use [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), which will recognize text from an image. 
The application will be cross-platform for Windows and Linux.

## Dependencies
